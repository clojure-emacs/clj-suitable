  The arguments to this function are

  1. `cljs-eval-fn`: a function that given a namespace (as string) and cljs
  code (string) will evaluate it and return the value as a clojure object. See
  `suitable.middleware/cljs-dynamic-completion-handler` for how to
  setup an eval function with nREPL.

  The last two arguments mirror the interface of `compliment.core/completions`
  from https://github.com/alexander-yakushev/compliment:

  2. A symbol (as string) to complete, basically the prefix.

  3. An options map that should have at least the keys :ns and :context. :ns is
  the name (string) of the namespace the completion request is coming
  from. :context is a s-expression (as string) of the toplevel form the symbol
  comes from, the symbol being replaced by \"__prefix__\". See the compliment
  library for details on this format.
  Currently unsupported options that compliment implements
  are :extra-metadata :sort-order and :plain-candidates."
